<h2><a id="p363"></a>On-Set Procedures</h2>
</div>
<p class="paranoindent1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">There are many ways to shoot a narrative film. The complexity of the project, the size of the crew, the nature of the location, and the style of the director all have an impact on what actually occurs on the film set. Director Kelly Reichardt shot her third feature film, <em>Old Joy</em>, with a crew of six, a principal cast of two, predominantly exterior locations and available light, and with everyone bunking together on location for the duration of the shoot (see <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/011_9780080885056_chapter1.html#p18">page 18</a>). Filmmaker Didier Rouget shot his second short film, <em>Vive le 14 Juillet</em>, in one day, on the streets of Paris, with three other crewmembers, two actors, no lights, and no sound (see this film at www.voiceandvisionbook.com). The shooting processes for these productions are bound to be different than those for your standard industry blockbuster film, with crewmembers numbering into the dozens and a veritable convoy of equipment trucks and trailers. There are many books on the market that explain in complex detail all of the tasks and procedures on a standard commercial feature film, but be careful: a production must adjust its personnel size and on-set procedures to the scale of the project, especially on short films, in order to keep the creative process from being weighed down by excessively elaborate logistics. On the other hand, you must make sure that you have adequate personnel, time, and equipment to pull off the movie you have in mind. This chapter looks at the basic on-set process for an average short narrative film with sync sound. While certain tasks and procedures can be scaled to fit larger or smaller projects and crews, there’s nothing in the following discussion that you can cut entirely.</p>
<h3 id="sec1"><span style="color:#7b8ec8">■</span><b>WALKING ONTO THE SET</b></h3>
<p class="paranoindent1">So you’ve thoroughly completed your preproduction. You’ve talked to everyone, rehearsed and discussed the script with the cast, and figured out the aesthetic and technical approach to each scene with the crew. Everything and everyone necessary to accomplish the day’s shooting is here, the location is secured, and you are armed with your marked shooting script, overheads, and shot list. Now what? Now you get down to the work of building your film one setup at a time, take after take, with the knowledge that being well prepared allows you to respond creatively to what is happening on the set. When you walk onto a film set for the first time, whether you’re a director, D.P., actor, art director, or sound mixer, you will feel something remarkable—the energy of a group of people who have come together to make a movie. You will also, probably for the first time, be in the actual shooting space and watching those actors in their costumes moving in that location. As you collaborate with the cast and crew, new ideas will start to emerge. If you know clearly the shots you need to make the film, then you are freer to improvise, cut, alter, or adjust, to accommodate new ideas or unexpected obstacles. Use the chemistry of all of those creative people gathered in one place and the inevitable surprises that occur on the set to improve the project at every turn. So get down to work, but remember that production is rarely just the mechanical realization of the film that had been developed in preproduction; rather, it is another creative stage in the evolution of your idea (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-1"><b>Figure 17-1</b></a>).</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 id="sec2"><a id="p364"></a><span style="color:#7b8ec8">■</span> <b>WHO DOES WHAT, WHEN</b></h3>
<p class="paranoindent1">Whatever the scale of your production, the basic stages for a shooting day are the same:</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">1.</span> Art department arrives at the location to dress the set (also called prepping the set).</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">2.</span> Camera and sound teams arrive and offload equipment to the staging area.</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">3.</span> Director and on-camera talent run a tech rehearsal in the actual space.</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">4.</span> Set up camera, lights, and sound based on that rehearsal while talent get into wardrobe.</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">5.</span> Run the scene a few more times, tweaking lights, camera, sound, and performance.</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">6.</span> When all cast and crew feel ready, take the shot!</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">Repeat these steps until your film is done. After a while, this routine becomes completely automatic for everyone on the project and, at last, you’re making a movie. But let’s look a little closer at each step for an average short film project, using lights and sound, and fill in some essential details.</p>
<h4 id="sec2.1">Dressing the Set</h4>
<p class="paranoindent1">The first team to arrive on a set, in addition to the director and producing staff, is the art department. The art department <b>preps the location, dresses the set</b>, and prepares wardrobe and props in advance of the rest of the crew. Often, the art department will be prepping the next day’s location while everyone else is shooting the current day’s scenes. On small films, however, it’s not always possible to have access to a location a day ahead of time, nor is it necessary if the set needs are minimal, which is often the case for exterior shoots, for example (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-2"><b>Figure 17-2</b></a>).</p>
<h4 id="sec2.2">Loading In</h4>
<p class="paranoindent1">When the rest of the crew arrives on the set, they begin the process of <b>loading in</b>, which simply means getting all of the necessary equipment onto the location. A very simple shoot might only involve enough equipment to fit in the trunk of one car, while larger projects, especially those with extensive lighting needs, might require trucks full of gear. No matter how much equipment you’re using, it is critical that you establish a designated area, near the actual set, where all of it will be held. This is called the <b>staging area</b> (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-3"><b>Figure 17-3</b></a>). When you need something, you’ll know where to find it; when you’re done using something, you’ll know where to return it. Orderliness is essential! When equipment gets lost, nine out of ten times it’s because there is no established staging area and equipment gets sprayed all over the location in the course of a shooting day. In this scenario, almost without exception, something gets lost. It may be something small, like a zoom handle or a filter, but it could be something expensive or essential, like a battery cable, a microphone, or a roll of exposed film from the day’s shoot!</p>

<h4 id="sec2.3"><a id="p365"></a>Tech Rehearsal</h4>
<p class="paranoindent1">With all the equipment now loaded in at the location, the question everyone is asking is, how and where do we set up? Each department should have their own copies of the marked shooting script, overheads, and shot lists, so they should already have an idea of the basic setups, but the director and actors will also stage a <b>tech rehearsal</b> in the dressed set (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-4"><b>Figure 17-4</b></a>). This is a basic run-through of the scene to be shot, including dialogue and blocking, so that the various departments get a more accurate sense for where to set up the camera, lights, and sound. The tech rehearsal is also the director’s first time running the scene in the actual location and viewing the framings from the camera. Changes to the visual conception of the scene at this point are common. Slight (or major) adjustments to the framing, merging shots, and rethinking the blocking of the actors are all are part of the tech rehearsal. Also, during the tech rehearsal the camera crew might lay <b>focus marks</b> on the floor. These are small pieces of tape that follow the path of a character’s movement in the space. They are measured to the camera so that focus can be accurately pulled as the character hits their marks, meaning as they move from mark to mark during the scene (see page 229). Once the scene has been staged, the departments get to work.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 id="sec2.4">Setup</h4>
<p class="paranoindent1">After the tech rehearsal the actors leave the set to get into costume and makeup and, if there is time and it is necessary, the director will run lines or quick rehearsals with them off the set. This is an important time between an actor and director. The director’s task at this point is to get the actors <b>into character</b>, meaning get them into the emotional and psychological space necessary to pull off the scene, and to remind the actors of the performance decisions that were made during preproduction rehearsals and read- throughs (see the section “The Director and Actors on the Set”).</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="display">

</div>
</div>
<p class="paranoindent1">Meanwhile, the camera department preps and sets up the camera, meaning cleaning the camera, selecting the right lens, setting camera speed, mounting the camera on the camera support, and loading the film magazines. If you are shooting on DV, this is where you will white balance the camera, and set all other necessary video adjustments. As the lighting crews set up the lights, the D.P. and A.C. take countless light meter readings and consults the depth-of-field charts to makes sure that lighting setup, exposures, and focus are in line with the visual strategy established in preproduction. If there is movement in the scene, the camera department will rough-in marks for pulling focus. The D.P. may ask an actor to stand here or there, or walk through their blocking again so that lights, camera, and focus can be more accurately established. If an actor is not available (e.g., they’re rehearsing or getting into wardrobe), then a <b>stand-in</b> is used (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-5"><b>Figure 17-5</b></a>). Ideally a stand-in and the actor have approximately the same height and coloring, and on major film productions there are specific people who are hired as stand-ins for particular stars. But on small shoots a stand-in can be any available crewmember. During the lighting setup the art department is also on set, laying out the various props for the scene and available to adjust set pieces or furniture in order to create a better composition or accommodate lighting issues.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="paranoindent1">While all of this is happening, the sound department sets up their equipment (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-6"><b>Figure 17-6</b></a>). Their first task is to strategize how to mike the scene given the environment, the blocking, and the framing. Should the recordist decide to boom the scene, they will wait until the lighting crew has finished their work before establishing the position for the boom operator, in order to fit themselves around the lights so boom shadows do not fall onto the set. If lavaliere microphones are used, then the recordist must find the talent and wire them for sound. This should be done while they get into costume and not while the director is working with them. Also, the sound crew will set up and test their recording gear to be certain they are getting a clean audio signal. In a single-system sound situation that means making sure the audio chain (mike → field mixer → camera) is hooked up, calibrated to the 1-kHz reference tone, and transmitting clean audio (see page 355). The same goes for double-system sound (mike → field mixer → recorder), except that the sound recordist will additionally record a <b>verbal slate</b> at the head of the record media (i.e., flash card, DAT, etc.), which includes (1) the name of the project and director, (2) the roll number, (3) the date, (4) the recording sample rate/bit depth, and, if your recorder has a tone generator, (5) the headtone level (i.e., −18 dB digital). Then the recordist will record 30 seconds of reference tone, which is used to calibrate the postproduction sound transfers. After this, the sound team is ready for the first take.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">From time to time the director will check on the progress of the lighting, camera placement, look of the set and the general readiness of the set-up. On larger shoots an A.D. will serve as the director’s proxy and oversee the set-up, communicating anything urgent between director and crew. This leaves the director free to work with the actors.</p>
<h4 id="sec2.5">Final Run-Throughs</h4>
<p class="paranoindent1">When all of the technical setup has been completed and everyone is ready to go—camera in place, lighting set up, sound in position—the director will call for a run-through (also called <b>dress rehearsal</b>). During the run-through, everyone proceeds as if you’re actually filming, without actually rolling camera or sound. This allows everyone to make final adjustments: actors modify movements and performance; the camera operator refines focus, camera moves, and composition; the lighting team tweaks the lights to get them just right; the art department addresses whatever set piece, prop, costume, or makeup issue needs addressing; and the sound team establishes boom position and final record levels. And all of this activity is happening under the watchful eye and instructions of the <a id="p367"></a>director, whose job it is to make sure that everyone’s creative and technical energies are working toward a single, unified cinematic goal (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-7"><b>Figure 17-7</b></a>).</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="paranoindent1">Sometimes a crew will go through several runthroughs before everyone feels they’re ready to roll; however, you need to be careful. You can tweak, adjust, fix, and rehearse endlessly. If too much time is being wasted splitting hairs or fixing things that no one would ever notice, the producer, A.D., or P.M. must step in and push things along by reminding everyone how little time there is and how many setups they must accomplish before the day is over, and that they generally need to “move it.” This efficiency nudge hopefully prompts the director to say, “Okay everyone, let’s try a take.”</p>

<div class="border">
<p class="paranoindent1"><b>in practice</b></p>
<h3><span style="color:#7b8ec8">■</span><b>THE SLATE AND PRODUCTION LOGS</b></h3>
<h4>First Level of Information</h4>
<p class="paranoindent1">The slate, the <b>camera report</b>, and the sound log are all used to keep a running record of every <b>camera take</b>. A <b>take</b> is defined as the moment the camera is turned on at the beginning of a shot to the moment it is turned off after the director has called “Cut!” Slate and production logs contain two levels of information; the first is general information:</p>
<ul class="square" style="margin-left:0.5em">
<li>Title of the project</li>
<li>Name of the director</li>
<li>Name of the camera operator (or sound mixer on sound logs)</li>
<li>Date</li>
</ul>
<p class="paranoindent1">This information doesn’t change much, but the second level of information, which identifies which scene is being shot and how many times it has been attempted, changes with each and every take on both the logs and the slate (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-8"><b>Figures 17-8</b></a> and <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-9"><b>17-9</b></a>).</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4>Second Level of Information</h4> 
<ul class="square" style="margin-left:0.5em">
<li><em>Roll number.</em> The roll number refers to the DV tape cassette or roll of film or memory card. When you change your DV tape, say after an hour of footage, or put a new roll of film in the camera, or fill up a P2 card, you will change the roll number. Roll numbers run sequentially, the first being roll #1, then roll #2, roll #3, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<div class="center">

Spot checks are recommended. Camera reports and sound logs are available at the Voice &amp; Vision companion website.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul class="square" style="margin-left:0.5em">
<li><em>Scene/shot number.</em> The scene and shot you are currently shooting (e.g., scene 19B) is taken from the shot list (which itself corresponds to the marked shooting script, see <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/015_9780080885056_chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>). The scene/shot number changes to the next on the list after the director believes that a good take, called a <b>keeper take</b>, has been achieved.</li>
<li><em>Take number.</em> This is the number of times you’ve attempted a scene/shot. This number changes each time you make another attempt at the same shot (e.g., 19B/take 1, 19B/take 2, 19B/ take 3, etc.), until you achieve a keeper take.</li>
<li><em>Footage or timecode count.</em> The easiest way to log picture and sound footage is to enter in the start timecode or footage count (film) for each take. This not only helps you keep track of how much film or tape you’ve used and how much you have left before you need to change rolls, but it makes it easy to find and cue specific takes later (especially when using timecode media). It also gives you an accurate time count of how long each individual take is since the start number of one take is also the end number of the previous take. For example, in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-9"><b>Figure 17-9</b></a>, shot 19B/take 4 started at 301 feet and ended at 274 feet (27 feet of film = 45 seconds). When using timecode media, it is even easier. The same take on the sound roll starts at TC 02:26:51 and ends on 02:27:37 (the start TC of the next take) = 46 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paranoindent1">In narrative production, slates and logs are used to label every take, whether you’re shooting on DV or film. On small-scale films, like student shorts, the A.C. generally keeps the camera reports and updates the slate, while the sound mixer keeps the sound logs. But if the A.C. is busy with other tasks, like pulling focus or elaborate dolly moves, the A.D. can also load the slate. In either case, establish a routine and stick to it; and compare logs from time to time; it is essential for a smooth and efficient postproduction process that the production logs and the slate are kept in perfect coordination. Also, filebased media, like P2 cards, allow you to enter shot information right into the metadata. This takes time, but if can work it into your routine it can be helpful later.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec3"><a id="p368"></a><span style="color:#7b8ec8">■</span> <b>SHOOTING A TAKE</b></h3>
<p class="paranoindent1">This is the moment of truth. All of the preproduction preparation, all of the setup and rehearsals, boil down to what happens while sound and camera are rolling. A take begins with the director or A.D. asking for “quiet on the set” and for everyone to get into their positions. Actors, camera crew, and sound crew all position themselves where they need to be. Then the A.C. (or whoever was assigned to load the slate) steps into the scene holding the updated slate (clapper arm already opened) for the camera to see. The camera operator must be able to clearly read the slate in the viewfinder. A slate that is halfway out of the frame, out of focus, or too dark to read is useless (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-10"><b>Figure 17-10</b></a>).</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="display">

Here the A.C. uses a flashlight in a dark location to ensure that the slate is visible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="paranoindent1">After everyone is in position and it’s quiet on the set, the A.D. (or the director on very small shoots) then calls the shot. <b>Calling the shot</b> is a standardized routine for every sync sound take on a double-system film production. The order and commands are designed to make syncing dailies in postproduction routine. Here’s how the director calls a shot:</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">1.</span> A.D. (or Director): “Is anyone not ready?” If no one says anything, then …</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">2.</span> A.D. (or Director): “Roll sound.”</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">3.</span> SOUND REC.: Starts recorder and after a five- second preroll calls out, “Speed.”</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">4.</span> A.D. (or Director): “Roll camera.”</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">5.</span> CAMERA OP.: Starts camera and calls, “Rolling.”</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">6.</span> A.C. (or other slate person): When the slate person hears “Rolling,” they call out the scene and take numbers, “Scene 19B, take 1,” clap the slate closed, and move quickly out of the scene and settles down quietly!</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">7.</span> <a id="p369"></a>DIRECTOR (after a pause): “Action!”</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">8.</span> The take plays out and the director will wait a beat after the scene has ended before calling out …</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">9.</span> DIRECTOR: “Cut!” No one can call cut except the director and no one stops their jobs until the director calls “cut.” There may be a great reaction or visual tableau at the end of a scene that the director wants to linger on, and if the camera operator simply turns off the camera because they thought the scene was over, they’ve lost a great moment. Also, a director should not call “cut” exactly at the end of the shot; it’s wise to wait a beat or two to give yourself handles for editing. However, the director can certainly call “cut” before the scene is done if something egregious has occurred, like a piece of the set falling over, the actor speaking the wrong lines, or a police car driving past with the siren wailing.</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">10.</span> When “cut” is called, the take is over and the camera and sound recorder are turned off.</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">11.</span> Immediately after a take, the camera report and sound logs are updated as the slate is reloaded for the next take (and if you’re shooting with file-based media and you have time, you can enter shot information into the metadata).</p>
<h4 id="sec3.1">Evaluating the Take</h4>
<h5><em>Technical: Performance and Continuity</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">After the take, the director first checks with camera and sound for confirmation. If there was a technical problem, it must be communicated to the director at this point so that he or she can determine if a <b>retake</b> is needed:</p>
<ul class="square" style="margin-left:0.5em">
<li><em>Camera.</em> If the camera lost focus, or bobbled in the middle of the shot, or if a pan didn’t follow the actor or got a light stand in the frame, then a retake might be necessary.</li>
<li><em>Sound.</em> If the microphone drifted off-axis too much, or the actors delivered their lines so loudly that the levels clipped, or if the mike picked up extraneous noise (like a lawnmower starting up next door), or any other problem like this, you’ll probably require another take.</li>
<li><em>Performance or new ideas.</em> The director also evaluates the performances. Did the actor drop some lines? Was the performance not as good as it could be? Were the actions awkward or incorrect? Maybe everything was fine, but the director got some new ideas while watching the scene unfold. All of these things could also lead to a retake.</li>
<li><em>Continuity.</em> Continuity issues also must be considered. Did the actor have a cigarette in the long shot but not in this close-up take? Was the actor wearing a coat in the long shot but is now wearing only a shirt for the close-up? Is there a problem with matching screen direction or performance intensity from shot to shot? These issues also can require a retake. On projects that require a lot of continuity shooting, it is a good idea to have a dedicated <b>script supervisor</b>, whose job it is to pay attention to continuity details and to mark off shots that have been completed (see “The Lined Script,” section). Script supervisors also can do spot checks with the logs and slates to make sure that they’re corresponding properly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paranoindent1">If the director decides that another take is needed, then the problem with that take is noted in the camera and sound logs “comments” area and, after making the necessary corrections (technical or performance), the whole process is repeated for “take 2.” Keep in mind, the “comments” notes are important because not all “bad takes” are a complete loss. Sometimes a technical or performance problem isn’t a problem throughout the take, and there are some good moments that can be used in the editing. These should be noted as well (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-11"><b>Figure 17-11</b></a>).</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paranoindent1"><a id="p370"></a>If the director is happy with the take, then it is marked as a “<b>keeper</b>” in the logs and everyone moves on to the next scene/shot on the shot list. After all of the shots from a particular camera setup are completed, the camera and lighting move to the next angle and setup begins again. This system is repeated, take after take, setup after setup, scene after scene, day after day, until you’ve got your movie “<b>in the can</b>.”</p>
<h5><em>Other Retake Factors</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">There will be times when everything on a take went relatively well, but the actor or D.P. feel that they could have done better or want to try something new, or feel that with one more take they can really do something extraordinary. In these cases they should ask the director for another take. If you can afford the time and the footage, it’s a good idea to listen to these requests.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">Sometimes, when cast and crew nail the scene on the very first take, a bizarre superstition takes hold of everyone and they think, “It can’t have been that easy.” Or “What if something happens to that take? It’s the only one we’ve got.” In these cases, the director may call for another take, “just for safety’s sake.” This is called a <b>safety take</b>. The funny thing is, there is often some problem with the safety take (technical or performance) and then people will inevitably want to do retakes of the safety take, and so on. Still, safety takes are a good idea, if only to give you some options in the editing room.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">There will also surely be times when you are running out of time or film or both and simply not getting the entire shot you’re after in a single take. This situation calls for the director to be crafty. Perhaps you have everything you need, but it is distributed in good moments among several “imperfect” takes. Maybe all you need to do is shoot a cutaway, or a simple reaction shot of someone else, which will then allow you to piece together the best parts of various takes seamlessly. It’s important that a director keep in mind during the shooting process the flexibility that editing affords.</p>
<h5><em>Checking Video</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">If you are shooting on DV and you are undecided about the quality of a take, you can always rewind the tape, or cue the P2 card, and watch the shot (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-12"><b>Figure 17-12</b></a>). People shooting on film can also do this if they have video assist. <b>Video assist</b> (or a <b>video tap</b>) is a small video pickup device, attached to the camera viewing system, which records low-quality video of each take. Video assist is standard issue on big-to moderate-budget films, but it requires three things that put it out of reach of many introductory film students. First, it requires additional funds for the rental of the videotape; second, it requires an additional crewperson to operate the video assist gear; finally, it requires a camera that can accommodate video assist. Video assist is usually overkill for small film projects, which can do just as well relying on the observations of the director, D.P., sound mixer, A.D., and script supervisor.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">In either case, evaluating shots by checking the video can be helpful, but it can also be extremely time consuming if you have to rewind videotape to check each and every potential keeper take. Memory cards like the P2 card have the advantage of instantaneous random access, but still you need to watch the take in real time. Watching video also can drive you a little crazy in the quest for absolute perfection. You may find yourself doing retakes for things that no one would ever notice but that you see as a flaw. Some people derisively call the playback monitor the “video village” because of all the people who gather around it to watch takes, which can waste valuable production time. Directors who get into the habit of rewatching everything they’ve shot on the set can expect, and should schedule, a longer shooting period.</p>

<h3><a id="p371"></a><span style="color:#7b8ec8">■</span> <b>TAKES, rETAKES, AND mISTAKES</b></h3>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">1.</span> The camera and sound crew must be alert, aware, and honest about evaluating the technical qualities of a take. Everyone makes mistakes; this is what retakes are for. One time, while my class and I were shooting a brief scene on 16mm for an in-class production exercise, we shot a take of two guys playing “rock-paper-scissors” as if their lives depended on winning. The close-up shot involved a slow pan from one player’s face, to their hands, then to the other player’s face. The actors really nailed the performance and after calling “cut,” I turned to the camera operator and asked, “Was that good for camera?” The response was a less than confident “Uh, yeah, s’pose so.” “Was it good, or not?” I pressed. “Yeah, yeah, it was good.” When we got the dailies back from the lab, we all saw that the pan wasn’t great; it mostly missed the hands playing the game and the end of the move didn’t really find its final composition on the second player’s face, landing instead somewhere around his shoulder. The student knew the pan wasn’t good, but he didn’t want to admit to his teacher that he messed up the shot so he was less than honest with his evaluation. Unfortunately, and predictably, the photographic evidence was right there and undeniable. Obviously, it’s so much better to simply say, “the pan was off” and do another take, than to discover in postproduction that there’s only one poor take to edit with. Shooting on DV, I could have checked it in the field myself, but shooting on 16mm film ( without video assist), the crew needs to be especially exacting and forthcoming.</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">2.</span> In one of my own films, I had a scene in which a business executive delivers distressing news about imminent layoffs to his management team. The problem was, I couldn’t get the executive to deliver his speech in one clean take. Not only did he flub his lines, but the multiple takes were making him feel increasingly on the spot, and we discovered that when he got nervous, he’d start stuttering. After about five takes I became concerned about the amount of film I was burning on this relatively small moment. Because I planned to intercut the executive’s speech with the reactions of one particular worried manager, I came up with a workaround. I figured I had the first three sentences of the speech covered in one of the five takes. Then I imagined exactly where I could cut into the scene and we simply had him deliver two other, tiny chunks of the speech (no more than two sentences each) for the camera. After these two short shots, which he achieved in one take each, I sat with him on location and recorded the entire speech as a sound take only. This way, he could read the speech, sitting down, without the lights and camera on him. He was terrific, and I had both my images for intercutting and the rest of the speech to insert as audio under the anxious face of the manager.</p>
<p class="list-item1"><span class="label">3.</span> A colleague of mine recounted a time when, on her film set, she had an actress who was great during run-throughs but who got “big” when the camera was actually recording. “It was totally unconscious, but she couldn’t help it. She would turn up the intensity a few notches whenever she knew we were doing a real take.” In addition, retakes only made her performance even bigger. So the director told camera and sound that they’d secretly roll tape during the run-though and then they’d also take some scenes after the run-through, so that the actress wouldn’t catch on. Since they were shooting on DV, they put a little strip of black tape over the red light, which indicates when the camera is rolling. The plan worked and the actress’ performance in the film was convincing, “but we had no slates for her good takes otherwise; if we had slated, she’d know we were rolling.”</p>
</div>
<h4 id="sec3.2">Additional Shooting Procedures and Tips</h4>
<h5><em>MOS and Single-System Sound</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">If you are shooting without sound, called shooting <b>MOS</b> or shooting single-system sound, all takes are still slated but the commands for the sound recorder are obviously omitted and there is no need to clap the slate because there is no microphone or, in the case of single system, no postproduction syncing to be done. With both single-system and MOS shooting, slating is purely for visual reference, so the slate (with the proper scene information) is simply held in front of the camera for a few seconds after “roll camera.” Then the slate <a id="p372"></a>person steps away and settles so that action can be called. It is very common to have a mix of sync takes and MOS takes in a single shooting day.</p>
<h5><em>Tail Slates</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">Sometimes you need to get a shot off right away, or you’ll lose a special moment (like a boat cruising unexpectedly in the background or a perfect wind blowing through the trees), or you may simply want to roll camera without breaking the emotional focus of an actor with the whole slating procedure. In these cases we use a tail slate to mark the take. A tail slate simply means that the verbal marker and slate clap are done at the end of the shot, but before the camera is turned off. To avoid confusion with the next shot, tail slates are held upside down and called out as “tail marker” by the A.C.</p>
<h5><em>Checking the Gate</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">When shooting film, the D.P. (or A.C.) should check the gate after each “keeper” take. <b>Checking the gate</b> means taking a close look at the aperture plate in the camera’s gate to make sure there are no hairs, dust, or debris that would show up permanently on the image. Finding debris in the gate can also be a reason to do a retake. Checking the gate involves using the inching knob to swing the shutter away from the gate, removing the lens, and, with a small flashlight and magnifying glass, looking at all four edges of the aperture plate opening (especially the bottom edge) to make sure it is free of hair and dust. If it is clean, then shooting can continue. If the gate is dirty, then the offending hair should be removed with a soft wooden <b>orangewood stick</b>. Outside the film world, “orange sticks” are used for pushing back fingernail cuticles and can be bought at any drugstore. On a film shoot, orange sticks are a standard item in a shooter’s ditty bag because they are soft and will not damage the gate and do not leave debris behind (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-13"><b>Figure 17-13</b></a>). With zoom lenses, you can check the gate without removing the lens. Simply swing the shutter away from the gate, set the lens aperture to wide open, and bring the zoom lens all the way in. The lens acts like a magnifying glass, so the D.P. need only shine the flashlight through the front of the lens and scan the edges of the gate. If the D.P. finds a hair, then the lens, of course, will need to be removed to clean the gate.</p>
<h5><em>The Lined Script</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">After each keeper take, that particular scene/shot is then “lined off” with a red squiggly line on a lined script. A lined script is a copy of the screenplay that contains a record of what parts of the script have been successfully shot and from what angle. The lined script looks like a marked shooting script (see page 101), but the difference is that it reflects the actual shots taken rather than the shots as they were anticipated in preproduction. Most of the time you will be drawing squiggly lines across the shots you’ve drawn in during preproduction, but during the production process the coverage might change in some scenes; perhaps some camera angles were added or omitted or merged. Maybe the director decided that the master shot was all that was necessary and that close-ups were not needed. Or maybe the director realized on the set that adding a new close-up angle would be a powerful shot to cut to. All of these types of decisions are reflected in the lined script. The lined script also allows everyone to see at a glance if every moment in the film has been covered and how it was covered. Any part of the lined script without a red squiggly line still needs to be shot (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-14"><b>Figure 17-14</b></a>). There must be only one lined script on the set, and updating it is the job of a <b>script supervisor</b>, but on smaller shoots it can be done by the A.D. or even the director. Any notes about each take or reminders about how a particular scene was covered (especially for scenes that changed during production) should also be noted in the margins or on the back of the corresponding page, making this particular document an important record of the director’s ideas during production, which can be highly useful in the editing process.</p>

</div>
<h5><em>Roll-Out</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">When a camera roll reaches its end (the end of a DV tape or the end of a camera load), the D.P. will tell the director, “roll-out,” and the production will halt while the film spool or magazine, DV tape, or P2 card is changed. If you’ve kept careful camera logs, roll-out should be anticipated so that it doesn’t happen right in the middle of a long and elaborate shot. If you know you have a minute or so left on a roll, you should inform the director. After removing your DV tape, memory card, or film (in a changing bag if you’re using a 400-foot magazine load), you should immediately put it back in its case or can and <em>label it</em>. Film cans should also be securely re-taped closed. This point cannot be stressed enough: your footage is the most valuable thing on the set and you don’t want an unmarked, unidentified film can, videotape, or memory card kicking around the film set</p>
<div class="border">
<h3><span style="color:#7b8ec8">■</span><b>AFTER ROLL OUT</b></h3>
<h4>Labeling Film Cans and Tape Cases</h4>
<p class="paranoindent1">It’s important to take a little time out to properly and neatly label your film cans or tape cases right after rollout and put them in a secure location (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-15"><b>Figure 17-15</b></a>).</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="paranoindent1">Film cans, DV tapes, and sound rolls must be neatly labeled with the following information:</p>
<ul class="square" style="margin-left:0.5em">
<li>Project title</li>
<li>Roll number</li>
<li>Director’s name and contact information</li>
<li>Shooting date</li>
<li>Film cans should additionally contain <em>processing instructions</em> (e.g., process normal or pushed one stop), <em>type of film</em> (e.g., 7297), and <em>footage</em> (e.g., 400 feet).</li>
<li>Sound rolls should additionally contain <em>record sample rate</em> (e.g., 48 kHz, 16 bit) and <em>headtone level</em> (e.g., −18 dB).</li>
<li>If you are splitting a film core (see page 179), then the can containing the unexposed film should be labeled with the <em>type of film</em> (e.g., 7297), footage (e.g., 220 feet), and date.</li>
</ul>
<h4>File-Based Media Workflow on the Set</h4>
<p class="paranoindent1">Once you’ve filled a video memory card with footage (P2 or SxS), you have two options. You can simply replace it with a new card and keep shooting, gathering all full cards at the end of the day to transfer them after the shoot, or you can download your footin <a id="p374"></a>age right on the set and reuse the card. Usually the deciding factor is how many cards you have and how much footage you acquire. Say you’re shooting HD and you have only one 16-GB P2 card (16 GB = 16 minutes of HD footage), but you plan to shoot 30 minutes of footage in one day. At some point you’ll have to transfer the data off the full card so you can reuse the card.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">Transferring on the set requires that you have either a <b>memory card storage device</b> or a laptop computer (a PC with a PCMCIA slot or a Mac with a P2 card reader) and two portable hard drives (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-16"><b>Figure 17-16</b></a>). It is essential that you transfer your footage to two hard drives (one for editing and one for safety backup) before you reuse the P2 card. As you transfer your footage you should label the files with the title and date of the production. In the end, you will have all your footage as MXF data files on two hard drives, ready to be “ingested” directly into your editing system. If it’s possible, it’s a good idea to have at least two memory cards on the set, even if the other is as small as 8 GB, so that while one is being downloaded you can continue shooting with the other.</p>

Two options are dedicated storage devices, such as the Nexto Video Storage Pro, which transfers both P2 and SxS cards to an internal drive and to a second backup drive (<em>left</em>), or using a laptop with a card reader to transfer to two portable drives (<em>right</em>). Always transfer to two drives before reusing your memory card.</p>

<h4 id="sec3.3">After the Shoot</h4>
<h5><em>Striking the Set</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">After the last “cut” has been called and the day’s final keeper take has been logged, the work is not over. The last task of a film crew’s day is to strike the set. Because this happens at the very end of a long day, you can be sure that everyone on the set is exhausted and wants to get home—and for this reason everyone must contribute to striking the set. It is a serious breach of film production ethics to participate in a shoot, but then skip out when it comes time to strike. No one leaves until everything is packed up and squared away. When crewmembers commit to a film, they must commit to the bitter end, which means that they need to clear their schedules and be there when it’s time to put all the toys away (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-17"><b>Figure 17-17</b></a>). Striking the set must be done neatly, carefully, and thoroughly. If you simply toss the equipment aside to get it out of the way, you will only make the load-in and setup for the next day’s shoot all the more difficult and time consuming. Even worse, carelessly striking a set can damage equipment. Each department is responsible for striking its own gear, but everyone pitches in until it’s all packed neatly away and the set is put to rights, meaning it’s clean and orderly. If you’re striking a set to which you will not return, make sure you return that location to its original condition or better (see page 381).</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="display">
<img src="./Chapter 17_ On-Set Procedures - Voice and Vision, 2nd Edition_files/ch17_page374-03.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="image" width="339" height="261" data-mfp-src="/library/view/voice-and-vision/9780240811581/images/ch17_page374-03.jpg"><p class="l-caption" id="fig17-17"><b style="color:#7b8ec8">■ Figure 17-17</b> Everyone helps strike the set. Putting gear away should be done carefully and methodically.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="paranoindent1">When the director announces to “strike the set,” all lights are immediately powered down first, but they are one of the last things to get packed away. This allows them to cool before you fit them back into their cases. Also, the sound mixer, D.P., and A.C. should take some time to organize and label all of the day’s camera and sound rolls. If you’re shooting film, the D.P. (or A.C.) needs to go someplace quiet to unload the last film magazine, <a id="p375"></a>which often means splitting the core (see page 179). Remember, exposed film needs to get to the lab for processing and transfer ASAP after a shoot.</p>
<h5><em>That’s a Wrap!</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">After the last “cut” has been called on the very last day of the shoot and all of the coverage for the movie has been accomplished, the director will gleefully exclaim, “That’s a wrap!” This means that the production phase is officially over. The last set strike is called the <b>wrap out</b> and includes returning the last location to its former state, and all equipment to the rental house, school checkout facility, or wherever it came from, and getting the last of the exposed film to the lab. After the last set strike has been completed, there is nothing left for the film crew to do but attend the wrap party.</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
</div>
<h5><em>The Wrap Party!</em></h5>
<p class="paranoindent1">The wrap party is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a party thrown soon after the final shooting day that brings together the entire production team, cast, and crew one last time (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-18"><b>Figure 17-18</b></a>). But this time it’s not to work on the film, it’s to have a good time, eat some good food, dance, share stories, and generally get to know each other outside of the intense and harried environment of a film set. The feeling of camaraderie at a wrap party bonds the team as they communalize the production experience that they have all recently been through. It’s also a way the producer and director can express their gratitude for the team’s efforts and for a job well done. Take note: I don’t mention the wrap party to be cute, I mention it because it’s an important part of this process. If your experience with the cast and crew was positive, you very well might call on them again in the future. In fact, they may call each other for their own projects in the future. One director friend of mine always hands out cast and crew contact sheets to everyone involved in the film. A good wrap party leaves everyone with a better final experience than a set strike, and it’s quite simply an essential part of creating and maintaining your film community. It should also be a line item in your budget!</p>
<h3 id="sec4"><span style="color:#7b8ec8">■</span><b>THE DIRECTOR AND ACTORS ON THE SET</b></h3>
<hr>
<p class="paranoindent3" style="color:#7b8ec8"><em>[…] 99 percent of my experience has been that actors, if you treat them with respect and ask for their expertise, they will share that expertise with you.</em></p>

<hr style="color:#7b8ec8">
<p class="paranoindent3" style="color:#7b8ec8"><em>A director contributes not by instructing the actor but by inspiring him. A performance is wholly the creation of the actor’s imagination, of the control he has over his expressive instrument (voice, body), and even more significantly of his emotions, sensory feelings, intuitions and mental attitudes.[…] In reality you are leading the actor on a very short reign, gently coaxing him into a performance that he must believe is entirely his.</em></p>

<hr style="color:#7b8ec8">
<p class="paranoindent3" style="color:#7b8ec8"><em>People often ask me what is the secret of directing actors, and they always think I’m being facetious when I answer that all you have to do is hire talented people and let them do their work.</em></p>
<p class="pararight"><b>Woody Allen (From <em>Moviemakers’ Master Class</em>, Faber and Faber)</b></p>
<hr style="color:#7b8ec8">
<p class="paranoindent1">In <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/017_9780080885056_chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a> I discuss the working relationship between directors and actors during preproduction rehearsals and the bond of trust that must be formed. So a productive, collaborative relationship should already be in place when you arrive on the set. However, more should be mentioned about the directing process that occurs on the film set.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1"><a id="p376"></a>In a significant way, an audience can overlook many small problems in a film if the performances are compelling and convincing. By the same token, a film that is technically flawless, or even spectacular, can fall flat if the performances are not persuasive. This is not just an issue on highly dramatic films with complex emotional situations and dialogue. A very simple film, with simple actions, can also be dragged down if the performances go awry. Here is a good example: In an introductory film class, one production group made a very simple silent film about someone doing their laundry. This was, in fact, their first film. The laundromat was beautifully picturesque and the shots were perfectly focused, exposed, and wonderfully composed. The lighting was simple but effective and the scene coverage and editing were sharp. In every way it was a visually successful film, except that the actor, who was not an actor but a friend of the filmmaker, had this slight goofy grin on his face. The grin said, “Hey, I’m on camera!” and it shattered the fictional illusion that the director had so carefully created. The film ended up not being about a guy doing his laundry, but about a guy who was aware of being filmed while trying to perform doing the laundry. It was the director’s job to not only organize the sequence of events and compose the shots, but to notice that revealing grin. The director needed to find a way to get the talent to drop it and to do this routine cleaning chore as if he were alone and had done it a hundred times before. Fundamental to the art of film directing is getting performances that are truthful and that emerge from the dramatic moment.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">To this end, it’s important that a director not allow technical considerations to pull them away from the actors. This is why the producers, the A.D., and/or the P.M. are so important on the set; they transmit the director’s wishes to the crew to keep them going, allowing the director to work with the actors right up to the point where the camera rolls. This is also why a reliable and resourceful crew is important; they can take their direction and run with it.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">The exact process of working with actors is dependent on many factors, including acting styles, training and experience, directing styles, the tone of the film; the unique circumstances of the production, and the particular actor/director personalities and relationship. This is a topic that is clearly beyond the scope of this book, but I have listed some texts in the Recommended Readings to introduce you to the essential aspects of working with actors in dramatic filmmaking. However, what follows is a basic (if somewhat idealized) description of the way actors and directors work on the set, during the production process.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1"><em>Tech rehearsals</em>: Tech rehearsals are not just for the crew; the tech rehearsals allow the actor, without the pressure of a rolling camera, to inhabit and move within the real space of the scene, usually for the first time. This has emotional/performance implications for sure, but it also has practical implications as well. If your scene involves any physical business at all—for example, making a cup of tea—this is where the actor will figure out where the tea spoons are located, how to open the tea bag, how well the kettle pours, in what order to perform the task, and so on. Figuring out these little bits of action at this point will not only improve the authenticity of the performance, but it will save you countless retakes because your talent won’t be rummaging cluelessly through drawers looking for a tea spoon in a kitchen that’s supposed to be their own.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1"><em>Setup</em>: One of the most important moments between an actor and director happens while the crew is lighting and setting up the shot. There is usually some significant time for work here, and this is when the director reminds the actor where this particular scene falls in the larger story. Remember, we do not shoot a film in sequential order; rather, scenes are rearranged in the shot list to create the most efficient order from a production perspective. It’s not unusual, for example, to shoot the end of a film in the first few days of a shoot. It’s not easy for a performer to jump around to the various scenes of what is supposed to be an organically unfolding linear story. This means that on the set <a id="p377"></a>the director must serve as the guide for the actors, reminding them, with each camera setup, where they are in the story, what their character has been through up to that point, and where they need to be emotionally in the current moment when the camera rolls. Thoughts and approaches developed during the script readings and preproduction rehearsals should be reviewed and any new ideas discussed. It is one of the principle jobs of the director to help the actors understand the story and their characters, speaking in very specific terms about what you want to do with that story and how you intend to present and inflect the characters, actions, and dialogue in the script. This, of course is predicated on the fact that you, as the director, know what you’re after first, and then find way to communicate that to the actors so that they can achieve the performance energy, mood, and nuance the movie needs.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1"><em>Run-throughs</em>: Once everything is set up and the actors are finally in front of the camera, you will do a few run-throughs before you roll camera. With each run-through, first ask the actors how the scene felt to them and what they thought about the way the scene is or isn’t working. Use whatever is useful in their comments, and explain why you can’t use other aspects of their feedback. Keep all comments and discussion constructive and focused on the story and scene at hand. In other words, simply talk with your collaborator and work it out. The next run-through should be a bit closer and the following one closer still. Just at the point when you think the cast and crew are comfortable, in the zone, and ready to “nail it,” that’s when the director announces, “Let’s try a take.”</p>
<p class="paranoindent1"><em>Takes</em>: It’s not uncommon that the actors (and crew) are thrown off a bit on the first take of a new scene (especially early on in the shooting schedule). The added element of being recorded for all posterity can itself impose on a performance. If the take is not what you were after, simply talk with your collaborator again. Start with what was working well in order to zero in on what you think isn’t working and why it’s not working. Often, it’s a simple fix, like more or less physical action, shifting the character’s gaze or blocking somewhat, offering a few suggestions for performance adjustments, or simply giving the actors a few more tries to find their focus. Other times it’s more complex, like when it becomes clear that the dialogue or scene coverage needs reworking or an actor is emotionally dissipated and simply cannot connect to what you have in mind. In any case, a director needs to be sensitive to all possibilities and do whatever is necessary to get the right performance on film. If that means rewriting a few lines, do it; if it means a few extra takes, do it; if it means letting the actor stir their tea with their left hand instead of their right, do it; if it means taking a few minutes to remind the actor of the scene work you did earlier, do it; if it means finding a new camera angle, do it; if it means clearing the set of unnecessary personnel, do it; if it means rearranging the schedule so that you can take another day to work the scene in rehearsal, do it. Don’t go with an unconvincing or inappropriate performance and hope no one will notice. The job of the director is to guide both cast and crew so that their collective creative efforts successfully fulfill a single creative goal, a unified vision of a story told on film. If a director has done the casting right, then the success of the performances depends on the director being able to communicate that vision in specific and workable terms, terms that the actor (trained and nonactor alike) can understand, absorb, and run with. With each take and with each adjustment the director and actors make between takes, you should get closer and closer to a keeper take. Then you move on to the next, and so on.</p>
<p class="paranoindent1"><em>A final thought</em>: It’s easy for a director to get completely invested in their preplanned vision for the film and insist that everything fit within that plan, and usually this isn’t necessarily a bad impulse. But a director should remain open and alert to surprises, inspiration, and unplanned gifts. Not infrequently, in the energy of the full production environment, a performer will find something new, fresh, and special. If you’re excessively wedded to an old idea for a scene or character, you might just overlook a performance gem and mistake it for a bad take simply because it isn’t what you had in mind.</p>

<p class="paranoindent1"><b>in practice</b></p>
<p class="paranoindent1"><a id="p378"></a>The director Kelly Anderson told me this story of using a simple and ingenious device for getting actors in the right emotional space while she was directing <em>Shift</em>, her first narrative film. <em>Shift</em> (1999) tells the story of Melanie, an unhappily married waitress who develops an intimate phone relationship with a telemarketer who, it turns out, is also a prison inmate. The scene Anderson was shooting was a wide two-shot of Melanie and Diane, another waitress, behind the counter of the diner, speculating about what Melanie’s telephone/inmate boyfriend might look like, since she’s never even seen a photograph. They kid around as they refer to various male customers off screen (“I’ll bet he looks like him over there”), some cute and some less than attractive. Because they’re looking and pointing to guys off screen, Anderson had her first A.D. stand off camera to give the waitresses a point of focus for sightlines. The tone of the scene was supposed to be lighthearted and full of fun, saucy girl talk about guys. But during the run-throughs, Anderson says, “It was flat. Flat, dull, staged and not fun.” She gave her actors some direction but nothing seemed to infuse the performances with the lively spirit she was after (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-19"><b>Figure 17-19</b></a>). She did a few takes and it didn’t improve. Then she remembered that, while the actresses were in makeup prepping for the scene, she overheard them talking about how “hot” the intern production assistant was. On the next take she switched the A.D. for the intern just as the camera rolled, so that the waitresses would be looking at someone they truly had a little crush on. “Immediately the tone switched. When they saw this really cute intern standing there they were both surprised and started to giggle and blush. Now they had something to work with and I got that fun, girlish spontaneity I was looking for” (<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/Voice+and+Vision,+2nd+Edition/9780240811581/027_9780080885056_chapter17.html#fig17-20"><b>Figure 17-20</b></a>).</p>
<p class="paranoindent1">What made this little directorial ploy possible was that Anderson could spend time with her actors while the crew set up, listening and responding to them even while they were in makeup.</p>
